                        <h2>Timeline</h2>
                        <p>
                        <h3>Life and Education</h3>
                        January 10, 1932: Prince Louis Rwagasore is born in Gitega, Burundi, as the son of King
                        Mwambutsa IV.

                        Belgium at the Université catholique de Louvain.

                        <h3>Involvement and Leadership</h3>
                        1956: Rwagasore becomes actively involved in Burundi's nationalist movement, advocating

                        a political party aimed at achieving independence for Burundi.

                        <h3>Path to Independence</h3>
                        1960: UPRONA wins a majority in legislative elections, but Belgian authorities annul the
                        results due to fears of instability.
                        1961: New elections are held on September 18, 1961. UPRONA, under Rwagasore’s leadership,

                        as a national hero and a key figure in the independence movement.

                        <h3>Legacy</h3>
                        Post-Independence: Rwagasore’s assassination is seen as a pivotal moment in Burundi’s
                        history, and his vision of a united and independent Burundi continues to influence the country’s
                        political landscape.
                        Annual Commemoration: October 13 is observed as a national holiday in Burundi, known as
                        Prince Louis Rwagasore Day, in memory of his contributions and sacrifice for the nation's
                        independence.

                        Louis Rwagasore, a key figure in Burundi's struggle for independence.</p>

                        <h2>Genealogy</h2>
                        <p>Prince Louis Rwagasore, born on January 10, 1932, in Gitega, Burundi, was the son of King
                            Mwambutsa IV Bangiricenge of Burundi and Queen Thérèse Kanyonga. King Mwambutsa IV, a
                            significant figure in Burundian history, reigned from 1915 to 1966 and was instrumental in
                            navigating the country through the colonial era towards independence. Louis Rwagasore was
                            part
                            of the royal Ganwa dynasty, which has a long lineage of rulers and significant political
                            influence in the region.

                            His paternal lineage connects him to a succession of Burundian kings who played crucial
                            roles in
                            the historical and cultural shaping of the nation. King Mwambutsa IV himself was a
                            descendant of
                            King Mwezi IV Gisabo, who resisted German colonial forces in the late 19th and early 20th
                            centuries.

                            Rwagasore married Marie-Rose Ntamikevyo in 1959, and they had two daughters, Princesses
                            Marie-Gisèle and Marie-Eshe. Despite his untimely assassination in 1961, Rwagasore’s legacy
                            continues through his descendants and the ongoing influence of the royal family in Burundi's
                            cultural and historical context. His vision for an independent and united Burundi has
                            cemented
                            his status as a national hero, with his descendants upholding his legacy in various
                            capacities
                            within the nation.</p>

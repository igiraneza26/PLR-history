                    <p>Prince Louis Rwagasore was a Burundian politician who served as the second prime minister of
                        Burundi for a brief period from September 28, 1961, until his assassination. He was a prominent
                        figure in the country's independence movement and was murdered just over 60 years ago, which
                        involved the complicity of Belgium during a tumultuous period in Burundi's history.</p>
